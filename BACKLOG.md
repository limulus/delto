# Delto Backlog

Organized as Initiative (`##`) → Epic (`###`) → Item (`-`); initiatives are roughly
priority-ordered, items 5 lines max. Refactors stays pinned at the top as a standing
top-priority initiative.

Each item starts with a 3-char alphanumeric ID prefixed `∆` (e.g. `- ∆OID Notify route —
…`). These “deltoids” are immutable and travel with the item into its final
`docs/journal/∆OID-slug.md` entry so cross-references stay stable. To mint a collision-free
deltoid, use `delto mint` once built (∆6zh); until then:

```sh
while id=$(LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'A-Za-z0-9' </dev/urandom | head -c 3); \
  grep -rq "∆$id" BACKLOG.md docs/journal/; do :; done; echo "∆$id"
```

Hard prerequisites use a trailing `; needs: ∆OID[, ∆OID]` suffix — logical blockers, the
only dependency mechanism in the `/delto` SKILL.md spec (v1.0).

## Refactors

Standing initiative — do not remove, even if no items.

## First npm Publish

Foundational initiative — what `@limulus/delto` needs before it can be published: the
`delto` CLI subcommands the `/delto` `SKILL.md` documents (mint, surface, claim, release,
complete), full test coverage, and a working consumer story (skill install via `npx skills
add` + tool via `npx @limulus/delto@1`). Shape decisions captured in
[ADR-001](./docs/decisions/001-delto-cli-and-skill-shape.md).

### Library & CLI

- ∆6zh Build `delto mint` — port `add-backlog-item`'s `mint-id.ts` to `src/lib/` +
  `src/bin/mint.ts` test-first (red/green), minting collision-free deltoids by scanning
  `BACKLOG.md` and the journal dir (`--journal-dir`), with `--count <n>`. Register in
  the router; needs: ∆qBS
- ∆SYk Build `delto surface` — port `plan-backlog-item`'s `find-eligible-tasks.ts`
  eligibility logic to `src/lib/` + `src/bin/surface.ts` test-first: traverse the
  `needs:` graph, exclude claimed and blocked items, emit eligible deltoids. Register
  in the router; needs: ∆qBS
- ∆ICw Build `delto claim <deltoid>` and `delto release <deltoid>` — port the claims
  ledger (`claims-ledger.ts`) to `src/lib/` + `src/bin/claim.ts` + `src/bin/release.ts`
  test-first; record/withdraw a claim so parallel agents don't collide. Register both
  in the router; needs: ∆qBS
- ∆yNQ Build `delto complete <deltoid> <journal-entry-path>` — port
  `complete-backlog-item`'s logic to `src/lib/` + `src/bin/complete.ts` test-first:
  release the claim and scaffold a journal entry at the path with `id` + `completed`
  (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS ±HH:MM`) frontmatter per the spec. Register in the router;
  needs: ∆qBS

### Skill Packaging

- ∆Rnm Cut over to the consolidated `/delto` skill — create the `.claude/skills/delto`
  symlink, delete the legacy `skills/<name>/` directories and the embedded
  `skills/lib/`, and delete any leftover `src/legacy/` files. The consolidated
  `SKILL.md` is already written; needs: ∆6zh, ∆SYk, ∆ICw, ∆yNQ
- ∆IsK Verify `npx skills add` reaches the consolidated `/delto` skill from the Git
  ref — directory layout and `SKILL.md` frontmatter resolve, and `npx @limulus/delto@1
  <sub>` runs the published bin end-to-end on a fresh consumer checkout; needs: ∆Rnm

### Packaging & Release

- ∆Rdm Real README + getting-started — replace the placeholders with what delto is, the
  install path (`npx skills add` for the `/delto` skill, `npx @limulus/delto@1` for the
  tool), and the backlog lifecycle linked to each subcommand's `--help`; needs: ∆IsK
- ∆Sre Verify `semantic-release` produces the expected `@limulus/delto` tarball — the
  `delto` `bin` entry and `files` per ADR-001's `src/` layout. No `main`/`exports`
  (bin-only per ∆iDx). Skill discovery is verified separately by ∆IsK (Git-driven, not
  tarball-driven); needs: ∆qBS
- ∆Bpr Enable GitHub branch protection on `main` — require PR + passing CI before merge
  so an accidental push (e.g. an agent in YOLO mode) cannot trigger an unreviewed
  publish

## Someday/Maybe

Work the current `/delto` `SKILL.md` spec (v1.0) does not call for. Parked until a spec
revision or concrete user need brings it back; logic for the first two survives in the
legacy skill scripts and Git history.

- ∆PZ3 `delto refine` — a `BACKLOG.md` structural linter (duplicate IDs, unresolved
  `needs:` references, dependency cycles, oversized items). Exists today as the legacy
  `refine-backlog`/`lint-backlog.ts`; not in the v1.0 spec
- ∆Stb `delto status` — a read-only progress report (per-initiative remaining work,
  eligible tasks, critical path). Exists today as the legacy
  `backlog-status`/`report-status.ts`; not in the v1.0 spec
- ∆Tmp `delto bootstrap` + bundled templates — a starter `BACKLOG.md` and
  `docs/journal/README.md` under `src/lib/templates/`, materialized into a fresh
  consumer project; not in the v1.0 spec
- ∆Pli Distribute delto as a Claude Code plugin so the `/delto` skill and the `delto`
  binary install together from a plugin marketplace, rather than `npx skills add` +
  `npx @limulus/delto@1` as separate steps
